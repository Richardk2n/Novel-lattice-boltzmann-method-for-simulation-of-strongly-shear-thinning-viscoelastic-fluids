Current viscoelastic Lattice-Boltzmann methods are limited to weakly shear-thinning fluids due to stability issues.
Our novel "viscosity shuffling" LBM algorithm enables simulations of arbitrary viscosity ratios.
This algorithm for the first time allows LBM simulations for realistic fluids, as the ratios achievable by existing methods are orders of magnitude from experimental values of cell-carrying fluids.
