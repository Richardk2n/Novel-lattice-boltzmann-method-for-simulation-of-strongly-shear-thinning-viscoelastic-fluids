There are several pre-existing LBM methods for non-Newtonian fluids.
The ones that support viscoelastic fluids are very limited in terms of viscosity ratio due to stability issues.
Our novel "viscosity shuffling" LBM algorithm enables simulations of arbitrary viscosity ratios.
This for the first times enables simulations for realistic fluid properties, as the ratios achievable by
pre-existing methods are orders of magnitude from typical values for cell-carrying fluids.
