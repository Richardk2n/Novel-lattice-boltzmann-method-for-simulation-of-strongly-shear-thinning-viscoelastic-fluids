	abstract = {{We present a comprehensive 3D numerical study of particles with imposed velocities relative to the local bulk flow (termed “slip velocities”) in a viscoelastic shear flow. We consider the force on a spherical particle sedimenting, a spherical bubble rising, and a spherical neutral squirmer swimming in an imposed viscoelastic shear flow. We demonstrate that any particle moving with a slip velocity in the flow or gradient direction of the shear flow experience a lateral lift force. We calculate and compare the magnitude and direction of the lift force in all situations. At small Deborah (De) and Weissenberg (Wi) numbers, our results show good agreement with an existing perturbation theory for rigid particles (Einarsson and Mehlig, 2017 [1]) and new perturbation theories for drops and for squirmers respectively. Our simulations extend these results to higher De and Wi regimes. Through our simulations, we uncover the physical mechanism of the lateral force on all particles. For rigid particles, we find the lift force arises from an imbalance in polymer stress on either side of the particle, which in turn is due to the imbalance of polymer stretch surrounding the particle. If this lift force is not balanced by an external force, a lateral drift velocity arises. We further consider the implication of this lateral drift for rigid particles hydrodynamically forced in a viscoelastic Poiseuille flow, where particles can migrate either toward the channel center plane or toward the wall, depending on whether the direction of the applied force is in the direction aligned or opposite to the direction of the Poiseuille flow, respectively. We study both the migration of a single particle as well as a suspension of particles in channel flow. Even with the addition of hydrodynamic interactions, we show that particles forced in the direction of the Poiseuille flow migrate towards the channel center.}},

	abstract = {{The stress in a suspension of incompressible deformable particles exceeds that which would exist in the pure incompressible liquid undergoing the same flow by the product of the volume concentration of the particles and the tensor \$\textbackslashoverline\{p\}\_\{ik\} - 2\textbackslasheta\_0 e\textasciicircum\{-(1)\}\_\{ik\}\$ where \ensuremath{\eta}0 is the viscosity of the pure liquid, \$\textbackslashoverline\{p\}\_\{ik\}\$ is the average stress and \$e\textasciicircum\{-(1)\}\_\{ik\}\$ the average rate of strain in particles in the flowing suspension. For a dilute suspension of viscoelastic spheres these tensors can be determined by using an adaptation of Jeffery's solution of the problem of an isolated rigid ellipsoid. In steady laminar flow, the material of each sphere is continuously deformed and rotates within an ellipsoidal boundary of fixed dimensions and orientation. Approximate expressions are obtained for the steady-rate viscosity and normal stress differences in terms of the dynamic viscosity and dynamic rigidity functions of the suspension. These are valid either when the rate of shear is sufficiently small or when the ratio of the dynamic viscosity of the spheres to \ensuremath{\eta}o is sufficiently large. The three normal stress components are all unequal. In slow steady elongation of the suspension, the spheres suffer static deformation into prolate spheroids so the elongational viscosity depends only on their static elastic properties. It appears from the investigation of special cases, however, that this static deformation is not possible for rates of elongation above a critical value.}},

This imparts viscoelasticity to the fluid, a property responsible for various flow instabilities and major modifications to the fluid dynamics. Recent developments in the numerical methods for the simulation of viscoelastic fluid flows, described by continuum-level differential constitutive equations, are surveyed, with a particular emphasis on the finite-volume method. This method is briefly described, and the main benchmark flows currently used in computational rheology to assess the performance of numerical methods are presented. Outstanding issues in numerical methods and novel and challenging applications of viscoelastic fluids, some of which require further developments in numerical methods, are discussed.

@article{Poologasundarampillai.2021,
	abstract = {{Additive manufacturing platforms are transforming research and industrial sectors worldwide. In regenerative medicine and pharmaceutical applications, they facilitate the development of patient-specific devices for implantation, as well as in vitro models of tissues and organs for disease modelling and drug screening. A key example is extrusion-based bioprinting, where a bioink that contains cells, biomolecules and a support matrix (often hydrogel), is extruded through a narrow capillary onto a platform forming the desired structure. The printing parameters and hydrogel flow behavior likely determine the extent to which cells are damaged mechanically as they pass through the capillary. Here, we present direct observations of the hydrogels and suspended cells during the printing process to help elucidate conditions potentially leading to mechanical damage and cell death. Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy was applied to observe the real-time flow of bioinks through a capillary mimicking the conditions found in bioprinting. Bioink formulations exhibiting constant and shear thinning viscosities, along with UV-crosslinked gelatin methacrylol (GelMA) were studied, and cell viability of post-printed gels were measured via fluorescent imaging. Cell tracking enabled flow profiles of bioinks to be deduced. In agreement with current flow simulations, the constant and shear thinning formulations displayed a Poiseuille flow profile although with a plug velocity profile for the latter. The UV-crosslinked GelMA formulation exhibited a two-phase annular flow with gel morphologies depicting gross-melt fractures attributed to over-gelled hydrogels. Cell viability was higher in UV-crosslinked GelMA at high flow rates compared to uncrosslinked GelMA. The findings presented here will improve modeling cell-material flow during bioprinting through accurate estimation of flow conditions, in particular for complex materials. The novel imaging approach could be further exploited to provide process monitoring and feedback to improve the outcomes of 3D bioprinting.}},

@article{Wohlrab.2023,
	abstract = {{Biological cells are built up from many different constituents of varying size and stiffness which all contribute to the cell's mechanical properties. Despite this heterogeneity, in the analysis of experimental measurements such as atomic force microscopy or microfluidic characterisation a strongly simplified homogeneous cell is typically assumed and a single elastic modulus is assigned to the entire cell. This ad-hoc simplification has so far mostly been used without proper justification. Here, we use computer simulations to show that indeed a heterogeneous cell can effectively be replaced by a homogeneous equivalent cell with a volume averaged elastic modulus. To study the validity of this approach, we investigate a hyperelastic cell with a heterogeneous interior under compression as well as in shear and channel flow, mimicking atomic force and microfluidic measurements, respectively. We find that the homogeneous equivalent cell reproduces quantitatively the behavior of its inhomogeneous counterpart, and that this equality is largely independent of the stiffness or spatial distribution of the heterogeneity.}},

Those deformations, in turn, strongly depend on the mechano-elastic response of the cell to the hydrodynamic stresses experienced during printing. In this work, we present a numerical model to simulate the deformation of biological cells in arbitrary three-dimensional flows. We consider cells as an elastic continuum according to the hyperelastic Mooney–Rivlin model. We then employ force calculations on a tetrahedralized volume mesh. To calibrate our model, we perform a series of FluidFM® compression experiments with REF52 cells demonstrating that all three parameters of the Mooney–Rivlin model are required for a good description of the experimental data at very large deformations up to 80\%. In addition, we validate the model by comparing to previous AFM experiments on bovine endothelial cells and artificial hydrogel particles. To investigate cell deformation in flow, we incorporate our model into Lattice Boltzmann simulations via an Immersed-Boundary algorithm. In linear shear flows, our model shows excellent agreement with analytical calculations and previous simulation data.}},

	abstract = {{Bioprinting of living cells can cause major shape deformations, which may severely affect cell survival and functionality. While the shear stresses occurring during cell flow through the printer nozzle have been quantified to some extent, the extensional stresses occurring as cells leave the nozzle into the free printing strand have been mostly ignored. Here we use lattice Boltzmann simulations together with a finite-element based cell model to study cell deformation inside the nozzle and at its exit. Our simulation results are in good qualitative agreement with experimental microscopy images. We show that, for cells flowing in the center of the nozzle, extensional stresses can be significant while, for cells flowing off-center, their deformation is dominated by the shear flow inside the nozzle. From the results of these simulations, we develop two simple methods that only require the printing parameters (nozzle diameter, flow rate, bioink rheology) to (i) accurately predict the maximum cell stress occurring during the three-dimensional bioprinting process and (ii) approximately predict the cell strains caused by the elongational flow at the nozzle exit.}},

	abstract = {{In life sciences, the material properties of suspended cells have attained significance close to that of fluorescent markers but with the advantage of label-free and unbiased sample characterization. Until recently, cell rheological measurements were either limited by acquisition throughput, excessive post processing, or low-throughput real-time analysis. Real-time deformability cytometry expanded the application of mechanical cell assays to fast on-the-fly phenotyping of large sample sizes, but has been restricted to single material parameters as the Young’s modulus. Here, we introduce dynamic real-time deformability cytometry for comprehensive cell rheological measurements at up to 100 cells per second. Utilizing Fourier decomposition, our microfluidic method is able to disentangle cell response to complex hydrodynamic stress distributions and to determine viscoelastic parameters independent of cell shape. We demonstrate the application of our technology for peripheral blood cells in whole blood samples including the discrimination of B- and CD4+ T-lymphocytes by cell rheological properties. Real-time deformability cytometry (RT-DC) is used for mechanical cell phenotyping but is limited to a single snapshot per cell and can only measure elastic modulus. Here the authors introduce dynamic RT-DC which can measure elasticity and viscosity in single cells by following dynamic cell shape changes.}},

A first routine measure to narrow down diagnosis in clinical practice is the differential blood count, determining the frequency of all major blood cells. What is lacking to advance initial blood diagnostics is an unbiased and quick functional assessment of blood that can narrow down the diagnosis and generate specific hypotheses. To address this need, we introduce the continuous, cell-by-cell morpho-rheological (MORE) analysis of diluted whole blood, without labeling, enrichment or separation, at rates of 1000 cells/sec. In a drop of blood we can identify all major blood cells and characterize their pathological changes in several disease conditions in vitro and in patient samples. This approach takes previous results of mechanical studies on specifically isolated blood cells to the level of application directly in blood and adds a functional dimension to conventional blood analysis.}},
