# Novel lattice boltzmann method for simulation of strongly shear thinning viscoelastic fluids

This repo contains all the code to build the 2024 publication[^1] of the same name.
Feel free to cite me, if you found this usefull.
This repo exists for transparancy, for easy copying of equations and to fix small errors, which will not be fixed in the publication by the journal.
The state as is represented here is the state before the journals editors changed things against my explicitly stated will.
[assets/README.md](assets/README.md) explains the relationship between data, scripts and plots.

## Data
The full data is not included in the repo, due to it being too large.
A backup is keept by Stephan Gekle (@sgekle).

## Simulation software
Will be published with my PhD thesis (approx. end of 2025).

## LICENSE
This repo has no LICENSE (aka all rights reserved) as this would be hard to do legally correct.
The publication itself is licenced CC-BY.
Currently I need to formally maintain all rights to the code as parts of it will be published with my PhD thesis.
However, as long as you do not try to pass it off as your own, I am unlikely to enforce my rights :wink:.
